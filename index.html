        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Victor is a graduate of The Ohio State University with a B.S. in Civil Engineering & Global Option in Engineering distinction. After graduating he joined IBM as an SAP Consultant, helping client's modernize and streamline their IT infrastructure (specifically "Enterprise Resource Planning" or ERP software)  and businesses processes. About 5 years later he moved to Accenture where he currently works as a Business & Integration Architecture Consultant helping clients align their business perogatives with SAP-centric technology & industry specific best-practices for their operations.</p>
        <p>SAP is a widely adopted ERP platform (similar to Oracle, Salesforce etc.) that allows an adopter or business to consolidate their typically disparate, complex, silohed and often custom-built applications that support their core business processes (i.e. financial accounting, supply chain management, asset management, warehousing, procurement, HR etc.) into a single, standardized integrated platform. The benefit of implementing ERP software for a large enterprise is that it systemizes and automates activities that would otherwise need to be performed manually (and are often not performed at all), generates electronic records of business transactions, and allows data from one section of a business to reference data from another section of the business in real time.</p>
        <p>A practical example of this would be imagine that a retailer requires the ability to have an employee (a "buyer") procure goods for the retailer to sell. HR data for the employee can be maintained in the ERP platform, the emplyoee could then create a purchase requisition (a request to purchase something) inside the ERP, the purchase requisition could then get routed to another employee who also has HR data defined (a manager) automatically for approval via workflow. Once the PR is approved, a purchase order (a formal document sent to a vendor indicating the desire to procure a good or service) could then be automatically generated & transmitted to a vendor. Once the vendor receives the PO and sends back an invoice, the invoice can be automatically paid based on defined rules & automatically update the financial acocunting books to document the completed transaction. When the purchased good or service is received depending on what it is it may need to be tracked as inventory or be accounted for as a cost collected against an asset (i.e. think buying bulk jeans from a factory to resell to customers in a retail store or buying HVAC maintenance from a repair company to fix an AC unit in a retail store). This example scenario continues on to eventually hit other activities that a retailer must do such as actually charge the customer for a sold good, manage the cash at a retail site, send outbound automatic invoices to customers for online sales and etc. The point is that a single ERP platform can often satisfy all of the core business process needs of a business and it can support, systemize, track, and or automate entire end-to-end processes.</p>
        <p>Without an integrated ERP platform in place, such as SAP, it is easy to see how much more astronomically complicated and painful something as necessary as buying a good to resell can become for a business...especially if the business is large like Nike or Walmart. In the previous scenario, there may need to be a database & application that stores HR details, an application that handles purchasing, there may not be any autoamated approval process at all and purchases may need to be approved via tracking them in excel spreadsheets/sending emails/making phone calls between individuals. Fulfilled purchase orders may not automatically transmit relevant details to the accounting department. Depending on how long it takes to summarize & transmit this information to accounting, there would a timing difference that misaligns what a business is liable to pay according to their purchasing system versus what the accounts payable books maintained in finance say. Received inbound goods may not automatically be updated into an inventory management application; and even if there is a robust inventory management application being used it would not be connected to the purchasing system--unless a custom interface is manually coded to connect the two platforms--so purchasing versus receiving could get out of sync (which would complicate your inventory accounting & collection of incoming customer receivables...the point is becoming evident). </p>
        <p>It is easy to see now the amount of manual work and reconciliation between different areas of the business & systems that become necessary when there is not an integrated solution in place. Think of all the insights you do not have visbility to if you have 5 different systems for an end-to-end business process that are not connected to each other with some steps being tracked and performed manually. Imagine how difficult it would be to pull a report to see the delta between paid vendor invoices & received inbound goods and services in such a scenario.</p></pIt>
